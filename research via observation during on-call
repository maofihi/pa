Title: Optimizing Browser Default Page for Enhanced User Experience and Reduced Server Load

Abstract:

As organizations continually seek avenues to enhance user experience and optimize server performance, this study proposes a strategic optimization of the default browser page. The current default page imposes a substantial load on the load balancer and server, especially during peak hours when a significant number of employees log in.

Objective:
The primary objective of this study is to recommend a transition to a lighter-weight default page design, akin to popular search engines such as Google. The intention is to alleviate the load on the load balancer and server, leading to improved response times and a more seamless user experience.

Methodology:

    Current Assessment: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the current default page's impact on server resources and load balancer performance. Monitored the system during peak usage hours to identify bottlenecks.

    User Experience Evaluation: Collected feedback from end-users regarding their experience with the current default page. Considered factors such as page load times, responsiveness, and overall satisfaction.

    Benchmarking: Compared the current default page's design and performance metrics with those of lightweight pages, particularly from popular search engines.

    Feasibility Study: Explored the technical feasibility of implementing a new default page design. Evaluated the potential impact on infrastructure, compatibility with existing systems, and associated costs.

Results:
The study revealed that the current default page contributes significantly to server load during peak hours, adversely affecting user experience. Benchmarked against lightweight pages, it became evident that adopting a simpler design similar to popular search engines could significantly reduce server load and improve overall performance.

Recommendation:
Based on the findings, it is strongly recommended to transition to a lighter-weight default page design. This involves simplifying the current interface, reducing unnecessary elements, and optimizing the page for quick loading. This strategic move is anticipated to not only enhance user experience but also alleviate the strain on the load balancer and server, resulting in a more efficient and responsive system.

Conclusion:
Optimizing the default browser page is a proactive measure to ensure a seamless user experience and maintain server performance, especially during peak usage. By implementing this recommendation, the organization can achieve a balance between user satisfaction and server efficiency, contributing to an overall improvement in the digital workplace environment.
