Overview

To enable single sign-on with Testeee, it must be configured to use Azure Active Directory as an identity provider. This guide provides information and tips on how to perform this configuration in Testeee.

Note: The web guide for using the Azure portal to configure this application can be found here.

Prerequisites
You must have a valid tenant or subscription with Testeee

Your tenant or subscription must provide the ability to configure a third-party SAML identity provider. To determine this, view your application’s documentation or contact the application provider.

Configure Testeee for single sign on
For users to be able to sign in using their organization account, Testeee must be manually configured to use your Azure Active Directory as a SAML identity provider. Testeee cannot prompt or otherwise allow users to sign in using Azure Active Directory if it has not been configured to do so.

To configure Testeee for single sign-on:

Review the process for configuring SAML identity providers in Testeee. To determine the correct process, view the documentation for Testeee or contact your Testeee representative for more information.

Note: Some guidance on how to configure Testeee can be found on Azure.com, and we are in the process of migrating the application-specific steps to this guide. The older article on how to configure Testeee can be found here, where only the steps related to uploading the Azure AD files and URLs to Testeee need to be followed.

During this process, you will be prompted to provide files and URLs that correspond to Azure Active Directory. When prompted, use the files and URLs shown below:

SAML Single Sign-On Service URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/698fbfe7-4a04-4920-9d40-6a2fb046b92a/saml2

SAML Entity ID: https://sts.windows.net/698fbfe7-4a04-4920-9d40-6a2fb046b92a/

Sign-Out URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/698fbfe7-4a04-4920-9d40-6a2fb046b92a/saml2

SAML Signing Certificate - Base64 encoded

SAML Signing Certificate - Raw

SAML XML Metadata

Once this information has been provided and configured in Testeee, Testeee will begin to require or otherwise allow users to sign in using your instance of Azure Active Directory.

Next steps
To ensure users can sign-in to Testeee after it has been configured to use Azure Active Directory, review the following tasks and topics:

User accounts must be pre-provisioned into Testeee prior to sign-in. If Testeee supports SCIM provisioning, see the Provisioning tab. Otherwise, contact Testeee support to inquire about your provisioning options.

Users must be assigned access to Testeee in Azure AD to sign-in. To assign users, see Users.

To configure access polices for Testeee users, see Access Policies.

three main backup rotation schemes in tape backups

GFS scheme. The most reliable option out of the avialable options, the Grandfather-Father-Son scheme is also the most popular backup rotation scheme out there. It relies on keeping multiple levels of backups, from daily to weekly and monthly backups. One potential issue with this approach is that it is probably the least cost-effective, requiring more tape to execute properly – and thus, generating a higher upkeep cost for the company in question.

Tower of Hanoi. A backup rotation scheme that acts as a sort of a middle ground between the most expensive and the most affordable ones, Tower of Hanoi is at its best when working with small or medium-sized businesses with relatively small data volumes. While it does cost less than the GFS scheme, it is also rather complicated in its implementation, creating a high possibility for an error to be made when swapping tape cartridges. Additionally, this rotation scheme has a requirement of a full backup for each of its sessions, making the entire process rather long and storage-intensive.

Five-tape scheme. The most cost-effective option out of the three, the five-tape rotation scheme is at its best when used for smaller businesses that do not have the requirement of archiving outdated information.

Data protection system should adher to the policies that have been determined. 
moving a backup into long-term storage
No one in IT should be determining how long back‐ups or archives should be kept; this should be determined by legal requirements, organizational requirements, and regulatory requirements.
Just like general FIFO rotation schemes, the daily weeekly, and monthly backup tapes are related using a first in, first out backup system.Retention should also specify how long things should be kept on each tier.

3-2-1 rule, which is: three versions of your data, on two different media, one of which is stored somewhere.
A restore returns a single thing to a single point in time from the backup.
A retrieve returns many things from a big date range from archive.

An archive is a copy of data stored in a separate location, made to serve as a reference
copy, and stored with enough metadata to find the data in question without knowing
where it came from. It needs to be a complete copy that does not require the original to function.

Archives are not used to restore a server or file to its original glory. They are typically
used to find data for purposes other than for which it was originally created. It may be
a related purpose, but it is almost always a different purpose.

A retrieve is very different from a restore. As mentioned previously, a restore needs
the name of a server, directory, database, filesystem, filename, tablename, and actual
date that you want to restore the system to. When doing a retrieve, you typically have
none of that information.
A retrieve gathers a group of related information based on its content and associated
metadata.

When you are doing a retrieve, you are usually looking for information, not a server
or file.

Physical air gap
A regular rotation schedule brought expired tapes back on-site after two weeks.

 retention is one of the things that are monitored in
your backup and archive system. You should ensure that the defined retention poli‐
cies are being adhered to.

A synthetic full backup is a backup that behaves
as a full backup during restores, but it is not produced via a typical full backup. There
are three main methods of creating a synthetic full backup.

Synthetic full by copying. The first and most common method of creating a synthetic
full backup is to create one by copying available backups from one device to another.
The backup system keeps a catalog of all data it finds during each backup, so at any
given point, it knows all the files or blocks—and which versions of those files or
blocks—that would be on a full backup if it were to create one in the traditional way.
It simply copies each of those files from one medium to another. This method will
work with tape or disk as long as multiple devices are available.The big advantage of this method of creating a synthetic full backup is that this pro‐
cess can be run any time of day without any impact to the backup clients, because the
servers or VMs for which you are creating the synthetic full backup are completely
uninvolved

An important consideration, when ascertaining what type of archive will work for
your organization, is how you’ll be storing and retrieving the data in the future. If it’s
thousands of plaintext log files, it’s reasonable to expect that those files will be reada‐
ble by some system when you need them.

The backup team will invariably be involved in the operation of production data stor‐
age, whereas the team in charge of the archive system may well reside in the records
management or compliance part of the organization, and could even be entirely sepa‐
rate from the technology function of the organization.

It’s important to consider whether the archive system you deploy will be separate
from your backup environment or whether it will be integrated with it. Ultimately,
the safe storage and protection of archive data should be considered critical to a
healthy data protection and retention system, but that doesn’t mean that the archive
system needs to be controlled from the backup system.

Your backup data can be used to re-create the data
from a particular point in time on your production system if it goes bang, but your
archive data is very much a historically important artifact that should be preserved
and protected.

We kept track of every piece of media via a barcode. These tapes were scanned by our
personnel as well as the vaulting vendor’s staff. Tapes were scanned into a box when
they left and then scanned out of the box when they were put on a shelf in the vault.
We had a system that would check that the tapes we put into the box had shown up in the vault,
and the tapes that they took out of the vault showed back up in our datacenter. 
A regular rotation schedule brought expired tapes back on-site after two weeks.
Any access to off-site tapes outside of the regular rotation schedule was highly regula‐
ted and well-documented.

• Number and identities of tapes in scratch
• Number and identities of tapes used and still onsite
• Number and identities of tapes used and offsite

When architecting backup systems, it is important to consider data to be backed up as well as data
that will be archived or stored for long periods. Although backups and archives are related, they are
distinctly different in character. Backups should be used to provide short- and medium-term protection
of data for purposes of restoration in the event of data loss, whereas archives provide long-term storage
of data in immutable formats, on static or protected media. 

Unfortunately, backups in many organizations tend to be used as long-term, “archive-like” storage
of data and are typically used to satisfy internal or regulatory requirements. They are typically held for
periods of more than 5 years and are stored in offsite locations under controlled conditions. As noted
previously, backups should not be considered as long-term archives for a number of reasons. First of all
is the problem of recoverability. Although the media itself might still be readable (some media has rated
static life spans of more than 30 years under controlled conditions), the devices that are needed to
actually read the tapes will most likely be gone well before that time.

To me they are two very separate actions that serve two very different purposes. 
hey are not archives; they are old
backups.
Moving a backup from an expensive storage medium to a less expensive
medium that is designed for long-term storage is not archiving a backup. There is no
such thing as archiving a backup; you are moving a backup into long-term storage.

Old backups do not magically turn into archives any more than old grape juice turns
into wine. If you want wine, you need to set out to make wine. If you want archives,
you need to make archives. Stop treating old backups as archives, because they almost
always are really bad at being archives. How long something is stored does not deter‐
mine whether it’s a backup or archive; it’s why and how it was stored that makes it so.
Now that we’ve covered what isn’t an archive,

An archive is a copy of data stored in a separate location, made to serve as a reference
copy, and stored with enough metadata to find the data in question without knowing
where it came from.

A backup is a copy of data stored separately from the original and used to restore that
data to its former state, usually after the data has been deleted or damaged in some
way.


Backups and archives are not mutually exclusive. As discussed previously, the use of archives prior
to executing backups can significantly enhance the performance of the backups by reducing the amount
of data required to be backed up at any particular point in time.
