Overview

To enable single sign-on with Testeee, it must be configured to use Azure Active Directory as an identity provider. This guide provides information and tips on how to perform this configuration in Testeee.

Note: The web guide for using the Azure portal to configure this application can be found here.

Prerequisites
You must have a valid tenant or subscription with Testeee

Your tenant or subscription must provide the ability to configure a third-party SAML identity provider. To determine this, view your application’s documentation or contact the application provider.

Configure Testeee for single sign on
For users to be able to sign in using their organization account, Testeee must be manually configured to use your Azure Active Directory as a SAML identity provider. Testeee cannot prompt or otherwise allow users to sign in using Azure Active Directory if it has not been configured to do so.

To configure Testeee for single sign-on:

Review the process for configuring SAML identity providers in Testeee. To determine the correct process, view the documentation for Testeee or contact your Testeee representative for more information.

Note: Some guidance on how to configure Testeee can be found on Azure.com, and we are in the process of migrating the application-specific steps to this guide. The older article on how to configure Testeee can be found here, where only the steps related to uploading the Azure AD files and URLs to Testeee need to be followed.

During this process, you will be prompted to provide files and URLs that correspond to Azure Active Directory. When prompted, use the files and URLs shown below:

SAML Single Sign-On Service URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/698fbfe7-4a04-4920-9d40-6a2fb046b92a/saml2

SAML Entity ID: https://sts.windows.net/698fbfe7-4a04-4920-9d40-6a2fb046b92a/

Sign-Out URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/698fbfe7-4a04-4920-9d40-6a2fb046b92a/saml2

SAML Signing Certificate - Base64 encoded

SAML Signing Certificate - Raw

SAML XML Metadata

Once this information has been provided and configured in Testeee, Testeee will begin to require or otherwise allow users to sign in using your instance of Azure Active Directory.

Next steps
To ensure users can sign-in to Testeee after it has been configured to use Azure Active Directory, review the following tasks and topics:

User accounts must be pre-provisioned into Testeee prior to sign-in. If Testeee supports SCIM provisioning, see the Provisioning tab. Otherwise, contact Testeee support to inquire about your provisioning options.

Users must be assigned access to Testeee in Azure AD to sign-in. To assign users, see Users.

To configure access polices for Testeee users, see Access Policies.

three main backup rotation schemes in tape backups

GFS scheme. The most reliable option out of the avialable options, the Grandfather-Father-Son scheme is also the most popular backup rotation scheme out there. It relies on keeping multiple levels of backups, from daily to weekly and monthly backups. One potential issue with this approach is that it is probably the least cost-effective, requiring more tape to execute properly – and thus, generating a higher upkeep cost for the company in question.

Tower of Hanoi. A backup rotation scheme that acts as a sort of a middle ground between the most expensive and the most affordable ones, Tower of Hanoi is at its best when working with small or medium-sized businesses with relatively small data volumes. While it does cost less than the GFS scheme, it is also rather complicated in its implementation, creating a high possibility for an error to be made when swapping tape cartridges. Additionally, this rotation scheme has a requirement of a full backup for each of its sessions, making the entire process rather long and storage-intensive.

Five-tape scheme. The most cost-effective option out of the three, the five-tape rotation scheme is at its best when used for smaller businesses that do not have the requirement of archiving outdated information.
