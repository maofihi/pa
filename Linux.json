Security

1. It's better to restrict users who can [su] to root if you enable root account like follows. For using by Sudo, 
it's possible to limit to prohibit shells in sudoers config.
2. For [su] command restriction, set like follows. 
3.  root@localhost:~# vi /etc/pam.d/su
# line 15 : uncomment and add a group which is allow to run [su] command

auth       required   pam_wheel.so  group=admcdhb

# add an user you allowed to run [su] to the group you set above

root@localhost:~# usermod -aG admcdhb mele
